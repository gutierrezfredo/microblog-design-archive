			 <p>Web design for Watsonfinds a sentiment analysis that predicts the evoked emotions by a piece of content.</p>
<p>IBM was one of the first companies who started building solutions with artificial intelligence and I was amazed by this new approach, specially by the <a href="https://tone-analyzer-demo.ng.bluemix.net/?cm_mc_uid=38480465967815654102949&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=31230421565410294965&amp;cm_mc_sid_52640000=39140861565410294987">Tone Analyzer</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by this, Max Ortu and I, had the idea to create a sentiment analysis that could provide, to authors, copywriters and all kinds of content creators, insights about the emotional tones of their content and a way to determine the emotions that their audience may perceive as they read it.</p>
<p>At first we designed a product that would connect and fetch the data from IBM Watson’s core, later on, we relied on Max’s past experience in Machine Learning to create our own data classifier, which is now the core of most of the products that we are still working on together.</p>

			 <p>UX/UI design of a web app that tells social media influencers how people feel about their brands.</p>
<p>A web app that works as a social media sentiment analysis tool to inform companies and influencers about how people feel regarding their brands by analyzing the emotional tone of the comments made by their audiences on their posts.</p>
<p>The app will use AI to scan and analyze every comment made on a specific post and show the predominant emotion. This will allow influencers and large accounts to filter comments by emotions and reach out to individuals who may be having a challenging experience with their brand.</p>
<p>The tool provides insights about specific emotions, such as anger and joy, over time. This allows the company or influencer to look for sudden changes or ongoing trends and see how sentiment varies across their audience.</p>
<p>The product never launched because it ended up being too much work for two people. However, it was a fun project that provided us with a lot of experience working with AI.</p>

			 <p>UX/UI design of a web app that helps contractors find and manage government business opportunities.</p>
<p>I was hired by FBO Biz to design a cloud-base solution that would bring a better way of managing and winning government contracts. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge was that the public solicitations published by the government had lack of organization. That’s why my aim was to design a product where the user could easily find and bid on solicitations, and at the same time maintaining an organized workflow during the bidding process.</p>
<p>As a result, I designed a web application that empowered the user to effortlessly find opportunities that fit their business capabilities, also bringing the clarity to follow up and keep track of any updates during the process. All this in a software that could be easily integrated with the company’s way of doing business.</p>

<p>I use Adobe XD regularly for my full-time job, while Figma is my go-to for personal projects. Consequently, I’m eternally oscillating between these two apps on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Having spent the whole day on Adobe XD, transitioning to Figma is somewhat peculiar due to the contrasting scrolling direction for zoom-in and zoom-out operations. Although neither direction seems inherently correct or incorrect, for some reason, Figma’s method appears more intuitive to me.</p>
<p>However, after a <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/adobe-xd-discussions/mouse-zooming-scroll-direction-is-reversed/td-p/11513112">much extensive search</a> for a solution, it was disheartening to discover that neither of the applications offers the option to customize the zoom scrolling direction. The sole work-around I could find was to alternately enable or disable the scrolling direction on my Mac.</p>
<p><img src="https://alfredo.design/uploads/2025/webp.net-resizeimage-opt.png" alt="Webp.net-resizeimage_opt.png"></p>
<p>But going to “Preferences &gt; Mouse settings” every time I needed to make the switch was a tedious process.</p>
<p>While wishing there was a quicker way to switch the mouse scrolling direction on my mac, I did some research and I found a tool called: <a href="https://github.com/ther0n/UnnaturalScrollWheels">UnnaturalScrollWheels</a> which exists as a solution for those who want to set the natural scrolling direction on the trackpad while maintaining the regular scrolling direction on the mouse. (Because for some reason, when toggling the “Scroll direction: Natural” option on a mac, it also changes the Trackpad scrolling direction).</p>
<p>With this tool installed, now I simply click the icon on the menu bar &gt; Preferences and check or uncheck the invert vertical scrolling every time I switch from AdobeXD to Figma.</p>
<p>I hope this is found useful for those UX designers, who like me, are constantly using both apps.</p>
